# Guides for Contributing
1. **KAY** uses **PEP8** as a general style guide, mainly for readability purposes. Contributions should be in the same general style.
2. **KAY** uses **type hints** whenever possible, this helps making the context clear and help the Intellisense giving you new code suggestions. See [this documentations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) if you're not familiar with Python type hints.
3. **KAY** aims to be used by **developers** and **people who knows programming**. To modify the core properties of the segment tree, one must modify the source code; the reason is because some features are hard to implement into the GUI of the application so you must know how to interact with the code (it won't be too hard on a basic level).
4. Be nice - try to be nice and helpful to another when contributing!

Thank you for reading and considering contributing.
